Project Outline: 

Create a chrome extension that displays a small tab on the right side of the screen. When you click the tab, or press Alt-A, a panel should expand. The panel should contain a heading, 'ChromeAi', and a chat interface, with the input element at the bottom of the screen. Use preact. 

When the panel slides open, the tab should slide open with it and stay attached to the left hand side of the panel.

the tab should be visible when the panel is closed. but slide out along with the panel as it opens.

the tab does not move along with the panel when it opens. 
it also does not toggle open when Alt-A is pressed

When the panel opens, the input box should be automatically focussed for input


Above the input box, add a button bar that right-aligns. there should be two icons that can either be both off, or one on and the other off, but not two on at the same time. They should bear icons that represent 1.the web, 2. the selection. (The selection icon should only be enabled if there is a selection made on the page before activating the pane)


when 'enter' is pressed on the inputbox in the chrome-ai pane. the `ask` function in #file:chromeai.mjs should be called with the query containing the content of the input box, the context containing an object that has properties 'web' and 'selection' set to booleans indicating the state of the context buttons above the input box
