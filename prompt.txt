Project Outline: 

Create a chrome extension that displays a small tab on the right side of the screen. When you click the tab, or press Alt-A, a panel should expand. The panel should contain a heading, 'ChromeAi', and a chat interface, with the input element at the bottom of the screen. Use preact. 

When the panel slides open, the tab should slide open with it and stay attached to the left hand side of the panel.

the tab should be visible when the panel is closed. but slide out along with the panel as it opens.

the tab does not move along with the panel when it opens. 
it also does not toggle open when Alt-A is pressed

When the panel opens, the input box should be automatically focussed for input
